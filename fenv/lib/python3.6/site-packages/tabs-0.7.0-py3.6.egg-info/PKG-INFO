Description: Tabs - Import tables in a consistent, maintainable, and readable way.
        
        Tabs is a Micro framework for defining and loading tables in a consistent way.
        The goal is to make data science projects more maintainable by
        improving code readability.
        
        Tabs comes with support for caching processed tables based on the current
        configuration resulting in shorter loading of tables that have already been
        compiled once.
